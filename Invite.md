<h1><center>Duggu's Naming Ceremony Invite </center></h1>
<p><center>Once there was a boy who had four sisters,<br>
Got a bit bored being the only mister;<br>
Prayed god for a twist in his parents wish,<br>
Grant him a brother rather than a sis;<br>
 <br>
Little did he know what the future would hold,<br>
  <i>"Share your clothes and toys"</i>, he was told;<br>
At five, the cute boy is a brother,<br>
Caring little brat than himself rather.<br>
 <br>
When he sings the little one claps,<br>
Drooling all over while sitting in his lap;<br>
  They are now the <i>“sleep buddies”</i>,<br>
Hugging each, like just born teddies;<br>
 <br>
Sometimes he calls him Duggu, Flash, Bheem and more;<br>
What do we finally call him? <br>come join us as we spread the lore. </center><br></p>
